## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learnt a lot through out the build process of this project being the fact that it was the first frontend mentor challenge i started with, it took quite a while to figure out the positioning of the elements in the components, and that was one thing i learnt via this project.






### Continued development

The aspect i would love to get a better at is the state management and interactivity of elements, font sizing and styles.
